# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 31, 2025  
**Application:** Eagle Viewer (iOS)

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Eagle Viewer was designed with privacy as a top priority. We minimize data access, do not operate any backend servers, and do not monetize user data.

The Application works with Eagle library folders located on your device or in your connected storage. Integration with Google Drive is entirely **optional** and used only if you choose to connect your Google account.

---

## 1. Default Data Handling (All Users)

By default, the Application works with Eagle library folders that you open through the iOS Files app.

### Data Accessed

- Files and metadata contained in the Eagle library folder that you explicitly select through the Files app.

### Data Usage

- Accessed files and metadata are used solely for browsing, displaying, and synchronizing your Eagle library within the Application.

### Data Sharing

- No data from these sources is ever transmitted to our servers.
- No data is shared with third parties.
- Transfers to or from network drives are handled entirely by the iOS system and the storage provider, not by the Application.

### Data Storage & Protection

- Files and metadata are processed only within the secure environment of your device.
- Any locally cached content or metadata remains in the Application’s sandbox and is protected by standard iOS security mechanisms (sandboxing and device-level encryption).

### Data Retention & Deletion

- Cached data and metadata related to a selected library are stored locally only as needed for Application functionality.
- This data is deleted when you uninstall the Application **or when you delete the selected library from within the Application**.

**Note:** The practices described in this section apply only when you use the Application with files accessed through the iOS Files app.  
If you choose to connect Google Drive, the data handling practices are described separately in **Section 2. Optional Google Drive Integration**.

## 2. Optional Google Drive Integration

If you choose to connect your Google account, the Application may request the following scope:

- **drive.readonly** — to view metadata and contents of files and folders in your Google Drive.

### Data Accessed

- Metadata of files and folders (names, IDs, structure), used to let you browse your Google Drive and select one Eagle library folder.
- Contents of images and metadata files contained in the Eagle library folder you explicitly select, used to display and synchronize your Eagle library within the Application.
- Basic Google Account profile information returned as part of the OAuth authentication process. This is used only for the sign-in process and is not stored or otherwise processed by the Application.

### Data Sharing

- Google Drive data is never shared with third parties.
- The Application does not transmit data to our servers (we operate no backend).
- All data remains on your device and under your control.

### Data Storage & Protection

- Accessed data is processed **locally on your device** only.
- To provide core functionality, the Application creates a **local cache of image files** from the selected Google Drive folder and **imports associated metadata into an on-device database** within the Application’s sandbox.
- Cached copies and database records are used solely to display and synchronize your library and are **never uploaded to our servers**.
- The Application’s Google Drive access is **read-only** and does not create, modify, or delete files in your Google Drive.
- Standard iOS security mechanisms (sandboxing and device-level encryption) protect locally stored data.

### Data Retention & Deletion

- Google Drive data is cached locally only as needed for Application functionality.
- Cached images and imported metadata related to a library are deleted when you uninstall the Application **or when you delete the selected library from within the Application**.
- No data is retained on our servers.
- You may revoke the Application’s access at any time via your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions). This will immediately prevent further access to your Google Drive data.

## 3. Analytics and Crash Reports

The Application does not include third-party analytics or crash reporting tools.  
If you opt in through iOS system settings, Apple may provide anonymized, aggregated crash reports. These reports cannot be used to personally identify you.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Application integrates only with:

- **Google Drive (via Google APIs)** – optional, used only if you connect your Google account.

Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the **Limited Use requirements**.

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.  
Since the Application does not collect personal information, it is safe for use by people of all ages.

---

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page, and changes become effective immediately upon posting. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
