**Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** August 31, 2025

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application **Eagle Viewer** ("the Application") for mobile devices.

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We understand the importance of your personal data and want you to feel secure when using our Application. This Application was designed with privacy as a top priority.

**1. Data Collection**

We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any personal information or personally identifiable data from our users. All data, files, and libraries that you open or manage with the Application are processed locally on your device. The data remains under your control and is never sent to us or any third party.

**2. Permissions**

The Application may request permission to access your files and folders (via the Files app or iCloud Drive). This permission is required solely for the app's core functionality, which is to allow you to open and view your libraries. We do not use this permission to access your data for any other purpose, and we do not collect or store any of your files.

**3. Analytics and Crash Reports**

We do not add any third-party analytics or crash reporting tools to the Application. Our goal is to collect no data.

However, if you have chosen to share diagnostics and usage information with app developers through your device's settings, Apple may collect and provide us with anonymized usage statistics and crash reports. This data is aggregated, does not personally identify you, and helps us improve the Application's stability and performance. We do not attempt to link this anonymous data to any individual user.

**4. Third-Party Services**

The Application does not use any third-party services or advertising networks that could collect information about you.

**5. Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since our Application does not collect any personal information whatsoever, it is inherently safe for use by people of all ages.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

**7. Contact Us**

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
